# Best Practices for Handling Indian Languages with Sarvam-M

## Summary

This document outlines the best practices for handling Indian languages in the Bharat AI Buddy application, leveraging Sarvam-M's native multilingual capabilities. Based on research and findings from [Sarvam-M's official documentation](https://www.sarvam.ai/blogs/sarvam-m), we've identified key approaches to optimize multilingual experiences.

## Key Findings

1. **Native Multilingual Support**
   - Sarvam-M natively supports 10 Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, and Punjabi.
   - The model supports three forms of each language:
     - Native script (formal)
     - Code-mixed (combining Indian languages with English)
     - Romanized/transliterated (Indian languages written in Roman script)

2. **Hybrid Reasoning Model**
   - Sarvam-M is designed as a "hybrid" model with "think" and "non-think" modes.
   - In "think" mode, it generates reasoning in English before producing a response in the target language.
   - This approach allows for complex reasoning while maintaining native language output.

3. **Benchmark Performance**
   - Sarvam-M shows significant improvements in Indian language benchmarks:
     - +20% average improvement on Indian language tasks
     - +86% improvement in romanized Indian language tasks

## Recommendations

### 1. Direct Native Language Processing

**DO:**
- Allow users to input queries directly in their preferred Indian language.
- Let the model process native language input without intermediary translation.
- Preserve the original language of the query throughout the processing pipeline.

**DON'T:**
- Don't force language detection as a mandatory step.
- Don't translate user queries from native languages to English before processing.
- Don't include language-specific instructions in system prompts that might override user language preferences.

### 2. System Prompts

**DO:**
- Use language-neutral system prompts.
- Focus system prompts on the task/domain rather than language specifications.
- Allow the model to determine the appropriate language for responses based on user input.

**DON'T:**
- Don't include language-specific instructions that might conflict with user language preferences.
- Don't instruct the model to translate its reasoning into a specific language.

### 3. UI/UX Considerations

**DO:**
- Clearly communicate Sarvam-M's multilingual capabilities to users.
- Make language selection optional rather than mandatory.
- Provide examples in various Indian languages to encourage native language use.

**DON'T:**
- Don't hide multilingual features behind complex settings.
- Don't present language selection as a required step.

### 4. Optional Language Detection

**DO:**
- Use language detection primarily for analytics and user experience enhancements.
- Implement comprehensive detection for all 10 supported languages in both native and romanized forms.
- Provide helpful hints based on detected languages (e.g., "You're writing in Tamil. Sarvam-M understands Tamil natively!").

**DON'T:**
- Don't use language detection to override user inputs.
- Don't force responses in a different language than the user's input.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Language-Neutral Processing**
   - Update the app logic to process queries directly without mandatory language detection.
   - Use language-neutral system prompts that focus on task domains.

2. **Enhanced Language Support**
   - Ensure all 10 supported languages and their variants are properly configured.
   - Implement comprehensive language detection for analytics.

3. **User Experience**
   - Clearly communicate multilingual capabilities in the UI.
   - Provide examples in various Indian languages.
   - Collect feedback on multilingual responses to continuously improve.

By following these recommendations, Bharat AI Buddy can fully leverage Sarvam-M's native multilingual capabilities, providing a more natural and effective experience for users of Indian languages.
