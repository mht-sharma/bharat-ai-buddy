- Multi-step reasoning with specialized agents for different knowledge domains
- Secure code execution capabilities for programming tasks
- Web search and website analysis for real-time information

## Quickstart

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py

  - smolagents[toolkit], markdownify, wikipedia, duckduckgo-search

## Usage Notes
- For trending/culture/news queries, the app uses a multi-agent system to fetch and summarize the latest info from the web.
- For math, code, and exam prep, it uses the Sarvam-M model for step-by-step or concise answers.
- You can easily extend with more tools or agents for even richer answers.

- `constants.py` ‚Äî Static data (languages, examples, exams, etc.)
- `model_utils.py` ‚Äî Model loading and response generation
- `quiz.py` ‚Äî Quiz logic and state

## Model
Uses [sarvamai/sarvam-m](https://huggingface.co/sarvamai/sarvam-m) for all reasoning and generation.

## Customization
- Add new tabs or features by extending `app.py` and modular files.
