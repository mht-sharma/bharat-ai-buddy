# Bharat AI Buddy - Tool Simplification Changes

## Overview

Based on user feedback, we've simplified the `solve_math_problem` and `analyze_code` tools to reduce hardcoding and let the LLM handle more of these tasks directly. These changes align with our overall philosophy of using agents to augment rather than replace the LLM's capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified `solve_math_problem` Tool

**Before:** The tool attempted to parse, identify, and solve different types of math problems using SymPy, with extensive hardcoded logic for equations, differentiation, integration, etc.

**After:** The tool now:
- Searches online for relevant mathematical approaches to the problem
- Provides these search results to augment the LLM's knowledge
- Performs only basic arithmetic calculations when obvious
- Lets the LLM handle the actual mathematical reasoning and explanation

**Benefit:** The LLM can solve math problems based on its training data while being supplemented with up-to-date information when needed.

### 2. Simplified `analyze_code` Tool

**Before:** The tool performed detailed code analysis with hardcoded checks for docstrings, complex functions, security issues, etc.

**After:** The tool now:
- Provides basic information about the code (length, line count, detected dependencies)
- Searches online for relevant programming best practices resources
- Flags critical security patterns that should be highlighted
- Lets the LLM handle the detailed code review based on its knowledge

**Benefit:** The LLM can apply its programming knowledge for code analysis while benefiting from supplementary resources.

### 3. Updated Application Logic

- Math tab logic updated to incorporate search results into the LLM's prompt rather than appending computational details
- Code tab logic updated to extract code blocks from prompts and augment the LLM with best practices resources
- Maintained CodeAgent for code generation as it provides particular value

## Philosophy

These changes reinforce our approach of:
1. Using tools to augment rather than replace the LLM
2. Letting the LLM handle tasks where it has strong capabilities
3. Providing supplementary information when it enhances the LLM's response
4. Using online searches to provide up-to-date information

## Next Steps

1. Test these simplified tools in various scenarios
2. Collect feedback on whether the LLM-centric approach provides better responses
3. Consider applying similar simplification to other complex tools if needed
